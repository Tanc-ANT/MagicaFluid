# MagicaFluid
This project is cross-platform fluid simulation.
I adopt SPH algorthm from Doyub Kim's [fluid-engine-dev](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev).

## Build
Clone the code recursively.

Windows platform need Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. 

macOS need Xcode5.

Just run the script in the Scripts file. Premake will build project automatically.
